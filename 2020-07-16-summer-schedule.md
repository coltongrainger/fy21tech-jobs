## Introduction to Programming in Java

### Elements of Programming

- Elements of Programming instructs you on how to create, compile, and execute a Java program on your system.
- Built-in Types of Data describes Java's built-in data types for manipulating strings, integers, real numbers, and booleans.
- Conditionals and Loops introduces Java structures for control flow, including if-else statements, while loops, and for loops.
- Arrays considers a data structure known as the array for organizing large quantities of data.
- Input and Output extends the set of input and output abstractions (command-line arguments and standard output) to include standard input, standard drawing, and standard audio.
- Random Web Surfer presents a case study that models the behavior of a web surfer using a Markov chain. 

### Functions

- Static Methods introduces the Java mechanism (the static method) for implementing functions.
- Libraries and Clients describes how to group related static methods into libraries to enable modular programming.
- Recursion considers the idea of a function calling itself. This possibility is known as recursion.
- Percolation presents a case study that uses Monte Carlo simulation to study a natural model known as percolation. 

### Object Oriented Programming

- Using Data Types describes how to use existing reference data types, for text processing image processing.
- Creating Data Types describes how to create user-defined data types using Java's class mechanism.
- Designing Data Types considers important techniques for designing data types, emphasizing APIs, encapsulation, immutability, and design-by-contract.
- Case Study: N-Body Simulation presents a case study that simulates the motion of n particles, subject to Newton's laws of gravity. 

### Data Structures

- Performance outlines a scientific method and powerful theory for understanding the performance and resource consumption of the program that we write.
- Sorting and Searching describes two classical algorithms—mergesort and binary search—along with several applications where their efficiency plays a critical role.
- Stacks and Queues introduces two closely related data structures for manipulating arbitrary large collections of data.
- Symbol Tables considers a quintessential data structure known as the symbol table for storing information, and two efficient implementations—hash tables and binary search trees.
- Small World Phenomenon presents a case study to investigate the small world phenomenon—the principle that we are all linked by short chains of acquaintances.
